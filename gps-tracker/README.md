# SDGP-PawRescue GPS
GPS module:The A9G board is programmed in order to handle real-time GPS tracking and sending of data. Its GSM/GPRS capability guarantees that so long as the pet is at any location, the location data is sent to the backend database, Firebase.
The board will communicate only with the mobile application, ensuring that the data is secured and access will be granted only to authorized users.
It has GPS, which would be connected to Google Maps API and Geolocator Plugin in the application to show the location of a pet and allow features such as geofencing alerts
